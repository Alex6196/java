question: Why String class is not preferred to store password in java? What should we use instead?

String class is not recommended to store password as a plain String in java because of Security reason.

String is not preferred to store password for following reason.
1. immutablity:
String in java are immutable, which means once the object is created, the values can not be change.

2. String pool:
Java maintains a string pool, which can cache string values. This means that even if you explicitly set a
String to null, the actual password may still be present in memory if it matches a value already in the string pool.

3. garbage collector:
When you no longer need a String containing a password and set it to null, it doesn't guarantee that the password is
immediately removed from memory. Java's garbage collector will eventually reclaim the memory, but until then,
the password may be vulnerable.

Instead of String we can use char[] or 'javax.crypto' library to securly handle passwords.
we can use 'char[ ]' to store password. because of its mutability, no string pool and controlled clearing.
